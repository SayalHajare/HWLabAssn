// Write a Verilog code that contains two registers (data and count). The data register is an 8-bit register. The program checks the LSB of the data register to be set and terminates. If the LSB of the data is reset, then it performs logical right shift operations until the terminating condition is met. Find the number of shift operations performed on the random test data (at least 5 Data after a certain time interval) using the while loop and count register in this context.
